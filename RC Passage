    The ancient Greeks are credited with the invention of democracy. This idea of rule by the people, 
    although vastly different in practice from our modern systems, laid the groundwork for later developments. 
    Athenian democracy, for example, involved direct participation from a select group of citizens, 
    in contrast to the representative democracies of today. However, it is essential to recognize that 
    not all inhabitants of Athens were considered citizens; women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded 
    from political life. As such, the Greek conception of democracy was far more limited than the current 
    understanding of the term.

    In the modern era, the term democracy has evolved significantly. It now generally refers to a system 
    in which the entire adult population has the right to vote for their representatives. This shift reflects 
    a broader acceptance of universal human rights and the belief in the equality of all people. 
    Nevertheless, the roots of this system are still deeply intertwined with the original Greek model, 
    even as societies continue to refine and expand the principles of democratic governance.

    It is interesting to note the different paths that various democratic systems have taken. 
    While some countries have adopted a parliamentary system, others have chosen a presidential model. 
    Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, and the success of a democracy often depends on how 
    well these systems are adapted to the specific cultural and historical context of the country.
